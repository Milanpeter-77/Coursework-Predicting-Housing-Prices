    "* Each group submits his/her own notebook via canvas on the assignment page.\n",

    "* Make sure you download the correct dataset. Loading the wrong set will lead to deduction of points. \n",
    "* The notebook should be named `MLF_ASS_I_YY_XX.ipynb` where `YY` and `XX` are the student numbers\n",
